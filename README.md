<h1>School District Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
The purpose of this project is to aggregate student standardized test scores across City School School District and showcase trends in performance.  The analysis will provide insights to assist the superindendent and school board with budgeting and priorities.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
The overall analysis was conducted twice.  The second analysis was required as a result of evidence of academic dishonesty surrounding Thomas High School ninth grade scores.  This analysis will cover the impact of nulling these scores.
</p>

<h3>Analysis of Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>How is the district summary affected?</b></li>
  Overall, the district summary was not vastly affected by removing the Thomas ninth grade scores.  Evidenced by Exhibits 1.1 and 1.2 (School District Summaries before and after removing Thomas Ninth Grade Scores, respectively), the Average Math Score went down from 79.0 to 78.9, % Passing Math dropped .2%, and % Passing Reading went up by .1%.

<li><b>How is the school summary affected?</b></li>
The school summary was only affected within the Thomas High School row.  Removing the ninth grade scores had a negative impact on the schools overall percentages despite the 10-12th grade raw scores remaining consistent with the original summary.  The percentage of students passing both reading and math plummeted by 25% overall to 65%. Please see Exhibit 1.3 and 1.4 to see all percentage changes.

<li><b>How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?</b></li>
Thomas High School dropped out of the top 5 in overall passing percentage after the omission of ninth grade scores.  Despite missing an entire grade level, Thomas High School did not fall to the bottom 5 schools in the district either.
<br><br>
<li><b>How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Math and reading scores by grade</b></li>
  The ninth grade averages for both reading and math were affected by replacing the Thomas ninth grade scores negatively.  The average 9th Grade Math Score for the district dropped by .2 points overall, while the average 9th Grade Reading Score dropped by .1 point overall.  This tell us that the Thomas High School ninth grade scores are above average as a whole.  
  <br><br>
  <li><b>Scores by school spending</b></li>
  The $630-644 spending range bin was negatively affected by the removal of the Thomas ninth grade scores.  While the scores themselves were completely unaffected, the percentage of students passing declined by 6% for Math, 7% for Reading, and 7% overall.
  <br><br>
  <li><b>Scores by school size</b></li>
  Thomas fell into the Medium (1000-2000) bin regarding school sizes.  While the Medium (1000-2000) scores themselves were completely unaffected, the percentage of students passing declined by 6% for all percentage categories.
  <br><br>
  <li><b>Scores by school type</b></li>
Thomas High School's revised scores again affected the Charter school percentages of those who passed.  The average score did not change, however both Math and Reading passing percentages fell by 4% and the overall passing percentage dropped from 90% to 87% for Charter schools.
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>Four Major Changes</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Thomas High School Passing Rates:</b> Thomas High School's passing rates dropped significantly, taking them from second best among schools in the district to no longer being in the top 5.</li>
  <li><b>Passing Rates for Schools by Spending:</b> By omitting the Thomas ninth grade scores from these statistics, schools in the $630-644 bin showed a decrease in students overall passing percentage in addition to Math and Reading individually.</li>
  <li><b>Rates for Schools by Size:</b> Medium (1000-2000) schools had their passing rates across the three categories decrease as a result of the Thomas ninth grade omission.</li>
  <li><b>Rates for Charter Schools:</b> Finally, Charter schools were the final category to suffer as a result of Thomas ninth grade's academic dishonesty, seeing all passing percentages fall as well.</li>
</ol>
