<h1>School District Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
The purpose of this project is to aggregate student standardized test scores across City School School District and showcase trends in performance.  The analysis will provide insights to assist the superindendent and school board with budgeting and priorities.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
The overall analysis was conducted twice.  The second analysis was required as a result of evidence of academic dishonesty surrounding Thomas High School ninth grade scores.  This analysis will cover the impact of nulling these scores.

<h3>Analysis of Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>How is the district summary affected?</b></li>
  Overall, the district summary was not vastly affected by removing the Thomas ninth grade scores.  Evidenced by Exhibits 1.1 and 1.2 (School District Summaries before and after removing Thomas Ninth Grade Scores, respectively), the Average Math Score went down from 79.0 to 78.9, % Passing Math dropped .2%, and % Passing Reading went up by .1%.

<li><b>How is the school summary affected?</b></li>
The school summary was only affected within the Thomas High School row.  Removing the ninth grade scores had a negligible impact on the schools overall scores as the 10-12th grade scores alone were consistent with the original summary.  Please see Exhibit 1.3 and 1.4 to see minute changes to raw scores.
