<h1>School District Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
The purpose of this project is to aggregate student standardized test scores across City School School District and showcase trends in performance.  The analysis will provide insights to assist the superindendent and school board with budgeting and priorities.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
The overall analysis was conducted twice.  The second analysis was required as a result of evidence of academic dishonesty surrounding Thomas High School ninth grade scores.  This analysis will cover the impact of nulling these scores.
